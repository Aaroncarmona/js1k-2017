## Description

Controls: left and right arrow keys to move, up to levitate.

After installing the latest smart home system your wizard tower doesn’t open anymore. The only way in is to climb to the top. Thankfully, you have a levitation spell but note that your magic is limited because you’ve spent most of it on home automation.

Tested in Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.
